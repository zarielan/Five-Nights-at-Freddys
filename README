# Five Nights at Freddy's Recreated

Ohai there! This is just a little project of mine where I recreated **Five Nights at Freddy's** by **Scott Cawthon**

Why? Well, as a beginner, I need to make games in order to learn how to make games. Well, I just found out I am horrible at thinking of what to make games out of. So I thought to myself, *Why not just recreate existing games? That's kind of making new games, except the concept and idea is already made up...*

Aaand that's what I did.

The game is rewritten in **Java** using **Libgdx**
