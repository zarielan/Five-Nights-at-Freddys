# Five Nights at Freddy's Recreated

Ohai there! This is just a little project of mine where I recreate [Five Nights at Freddy's](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/) by Scott Cawthon

As a beginner, I need to make games in order to be good at making them. And a better way to do that is to recreate games :D

The game is rewritten in Java using [Libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
